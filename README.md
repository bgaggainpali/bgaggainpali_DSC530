With the Stock market fall because of the Corona virus situation, I was surprised to see how the gold and diamonds prices are rising. I guess people are looking for safe investments, which is causing the prices go high. This generally happens when the markets are uncertain.
I got interested to do some data analysis regarding the diamonds. As I do not have much information about diamonds, I search about the data and found a dataset provided by Shivam Agarwal in kaggle. This dataset contains a lot of details and properties of the diamond like the price, shape, and other attributes.
